    "# Lesson 4: Call transcript summarizer\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we're going to write a complex prompt for a common customer use-case: summarizing.  Specifically, we'll summarize long customer service call transcripts.  Our goal is to summarize customer service calls for customer support metrics.  We want summaries of complete customer service calls to evaluate the efficacy of our customer support team.  This means we'll exclude calls that have connection issues, language barriers, and other issues that hinder effective summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine we work for Acme Corporation, a company that sells smart home devices. The company handles hundreds of customer service calls daily and needs a way to quickly turn these conversations into **useful, structured data**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some important considerations include:\n",
    "* Calls can be short and sweet or long and complicated.\n",
    "* Customers might be calling about anything from a simple Wi-Fi connection issue to a complex system malfunction.\n",
    "* We need our summaries in a specific format so they're easy to analyze later.\n",
    "* We have to be careful not to include any personal customer information in our summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help us out, we'll follow the best practices we described previously:\n",
    "* Use a system prompt to set the stage.\n",
    "* Structure the prompt for optimal performance.\n",
    "* Give clear instructions and define your desired output.\n",
    "* Use XML tags to organize information.\n",
    "* Handle special cases and edge scenarios.\n",
    "* Provide examples to guide the model.\n",

    "In this lesson, we walked through the process of developing a complex prompt for summarizing customer service call transcripts. Let's recap the prompting techniques we employed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* System Prompt: We used a system prompt to set the overall context and role for Claude.\n",
    "* Structured Input: We placed the call transcript at the beginning of the prompt using XML tags.\n",
    "* Clear Instructions: We provided detailed guidelines on what to focus on and how to structure the output.\n",
    "* Output Formatting: We specified a JSON structure for the summary, ensuring consistent and easily parseable results.\n",
    "* Handling Edge Cases: We added criteria for identifying calls with insufficient data.\n",
    "* Examples: We included diverse examples to illustrate desired outputs for different scenarios.\n",
    "* Thinking Aloud: We asked Claude to show its analysis in <thinking> tags before providing the final JSON output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By employing these techniques, we created a robust prompt capable of generating structured summaries for a wide range of customer service call transcripts, while appropriately handling edge cases. This approach can be adapted to many other complex prompting scenarios beyond call summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:** While we've developed a sophisticated prompt that appears to handle our test cases well, it's crucial to understand that this prompt is not yet production-ready. What we've created is a promising starting point, but it requires extensive testing and evaluation before it can be reliably used in a real-world setting. Our current eye-ball test evaluation has been based on a small set of examples. This is not representative of the diverse and often unpredictable nature of real customer service calls. To ensure the prompt's effectiveness and reliability, we need to implement a comprehensive evaluation process that includes quantitative metrics.  Robust, data-driven evaluations are the key to bridging the gap between a promising prototype and a reliable, production-grade solution."
